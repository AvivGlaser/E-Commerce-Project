## General info
Frontend only.
This project is a demonstration of an e-commerce site. The user can search, delete, add & create products to general product page or his personal cart.
Some initial products are brought through api request and are saved immediately to Redux and Local Storage.
The goal of the project was to use as much as React capabilities as possible.
From JSX and React Components, through React router dom, HOC, Axios, and of course React hooks.
