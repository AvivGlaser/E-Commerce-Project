## General info
Frontend only.
This project is a demonstration of an e-commerce site. The user can search, delete, add & create products to general product-page or his own personal cart.
Initial products stored immediately to Redux and Local Storage after received from an API-request.
The goal of the project was to use as much as React capabilities as possible.
From JSX and React Components, through React Router, HOC, Axios, and of course React Hooks.
